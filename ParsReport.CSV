1833,New,VT/OCS/OCS Design Guidelines,,Guidelines for the Design of Direct Current Overhead Contact Systems for Transit Systems,This guide defines the general design parameters of overhead contact system (OCS) design for direct current (dc) transit systems. The guidelines that follow are intended for new systems and for the expansion of systems where a legacy of design standards does not exist.  This guide is not intended to replace or supersede existing design standards but rather to formalize the design process.,"The purpose of this guide is to develop the performance requirements and design guidelines for direct current overhead contact systems. The guidelines here within should be used to address potential safety hazards, improve the performance and reliability of the system, and reduce service life cycle costs. These guidelines consider safety, system reliability, modes of operation, type of vehicle to be used, and maintenance factors.",Patricia Roder,05 Mar 2020,31 Dec 2024,04 Nov 2022,04 Jan 2023,Completed

P3357,New,VT/OCS/VT/OCS Pole Grounding,,Recommended Practice for Grounding Overhead Contact System (OCS) Poles and Supports on Light Rail Transit Systems,"This document gives alternative methods for the grounding of overhead contact system (OCS) poles and supports for OCS on light rail transit systems.  The recommended practice covers: technical grounding methods, why poles must be grounded, grounding materials, alternative methods of grounding OCS poles at-grade and on aerial structures, grounding design in areas where Direct Current (DC) and Alternating Current (AC) are in close proximity, field testing, maintenance of grounding systems and references to applicable codes.","This recommended practice advises designers of Overhead Contact Systems (OCS) and transit agencies of the alternative methods of grounding OCS poles and OCS supports that have proven successful on DC light rail projects. It discusses options for achieving good, solid and lasting grounding of OCS poles and supports that can be reasonably installed, tested and maintained.",Patricia Roder,30 Mar 2023,31 Dec 2027,NA,NA,Draft Development
P3425,New,VT/OCS/OCS-T&C,,Standard for Overhead Contact System (OCS) Testing and Commissioning,This standard defines field testing and acceptance criteria for the overhead contact system of transportation system applications powered by a dc traction power system up to 1500 V nominal.,"The purpose is to ensure that the installed overhead contact system equipment will function as intended by the plans and specifications, thereby providing reliable service for the anticipated life of the equipment.",Patricia Roder,08 Nov 2023,31 Dec 2027,NA,NA,Draft Development
P3535,New,VT/OCS/OCS Construction,,Guide for the Construction of Overhead Contact Systems for Direct Current Transit Systems up to 1500 V DC,"This guide establishes requirements for the construction of overhead contact systems (OCS) used in direct current (DC) electrified transit applications. It covers key aspects of construction practices for various OCS styles and configurations, foundations, supporting structures, insulation, wires, assemblies, industry accepted installation techniques, and safety considerations. The guide applies to both new systems as well as to the expansion of systems covering various transit modes, including light rail, streetcars, and electric trolley buses, operating with nominal system voltages up to 1500 V DC.","This guide provides a comprehensive framework for the construction of safe, reliable, and efficient overhead contact systems for DC electrified transit. It aims to: a) Establish uniform construction practices and requirements across different transit applications. b) Help nsure the mechanical and electrical integrity of OCS installations. c) Promote safety in the construction, operation, and maintenance of OCS. d) Enhance the interoperability and standardization of OCS components and practices. e) Provide guidance on quality control and testing procedures for OCS construction.",Patricia Roder,NA,NA,NA,NA,Draft Development
1791,New,VT/OCS/1791_WG,,Recommended Practice for Terminology Used for Direct Current Electric Transit Overhead Contact Systems,This recommended practice defines terms used for direct current electric transit overhead contact systems.,This recommended practice provides uniform terminology and definition of terms used for direct current electric transit overhead contact systems.,Patricia Roder,27 Mar 2014,31 Dec 2019,09 Mar 2012,04 Aug 2019,Completed
1896,New,VT/OCS/OCS  Working Group,,Standard for Identification of Contact Wire Used in Overhead Contact Systems,"This standard defines the general parameters for marking contact wires in overhead contact systems (OCS) used for electric railway and transit systems. This standard allows for the identification of various types of contact wires in composition and conductivity as well as identification of the operating agency using the wire. This standard is intended to provide a method of determining the type of contact wire as regards its chemical makeup and electrical conductivity and is not meant to replace any other marking or identification system for contact wire presently in use.  Instead, it presents an alternative method of contact wire identification that is concise and easy to interpret.",This standard provides guidance to manufacturers of contact wire for placing identification markings that identify the contact wire alloys with various conductivities. This will aid users of the wire to properly identify the type and conductivity in use on the line and on reels for proper application into the OCS. The identification of an agency's ownership on the contact wire will help in the deterrence of theft and aid in recovery by law enforcement personnel. This standard considers maintenance applications by operating agencies.,Patricia Roder,12 Jun 2014,31 Dec 2017,24 Sep 2014,26 May 2016,Completed
